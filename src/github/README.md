Want better Maven builds and releases? Just do one of the following:

+ [Download the extension](${libext.download.url}) into your `$M2_HOME/lib/ext` directory.
+ Create the file `.mvn/extensions.xml` parallel to your project's top-level POM, with the following content.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </extension>
</extensions>
```

[Read the official docs for more info.](${project.url})
