  Disables all build extensions.
  
  It seems that Maven will crawl up the directory tree, starting with the
  ${basedir}, until it finds a .mvn/extensions.xml file to read to
  determine which core extensions are required by the project.
  Without this file, libext IT execution will cause the .mvn/extensions.xml
  for the RTR project itself to be consumed by each IT; this causes the libext
  JAR file that is under test to be ignored and causes the IT to attempt to
  download RTR from the repository, defeating the whole purpose of the test.
  
  The presence of this file stops libext IT Maven executions from sourcing RTR
  from the repository, allowing RTR to use itself as a core extension without
  a modified Maven installation, while allowing RTR's libext IT tests to
  function as expected.

<!-- TODO centralize/reuse this file, in case future libext ITs are required. -->
